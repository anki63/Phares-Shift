# Phares Shift
 
- This is an experiment in manipulating audio at the bit level, using the Web Audio API. It's also a kind of homage to a couple Steve Reich pieces: Come Out and It's Gonna Rain. Where Reich spliced audio tape, this offsets the second track on each repetition, thus creating the phase.

#The select menu at the top left selects between the two pieces.

#Another select menu adjusts the phase offset/rate of change.

#The 'One Step' button lets you skip forward if you get impatient.

#And the 'Reset' button brings the two tracks back into phase.
